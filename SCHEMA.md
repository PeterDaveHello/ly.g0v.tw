- Session
    - Uniquely identified by "AD"(=term),"session"(1,2,3...),"extra"(null,1,2,3...)
- Meeting (references session)
    - committee(null),sitting(1,2,3,....)
    - committee(array(committee-key)),sitting(1,2,3,....)
- Committee member membership
    - unique(session,member-name,committee-key) within an AD
- Bill
    - bill_id (primary key)
    - When first proposed it's in a state of not-discussed
        - bill_id is always non-null
    - When discussing, the discussion itself is a bill (refs multiple bills)
        - bill_id is always non-null
- Motion
    - meeting(mtype=('discussion'|'announcement'),agendaItem,subItem) => bill_id  # at INSERT, either;
        - meeting(mtype,item) => bill_id                # After UPDATE
        - (mtype='announcement',reply=>(mtype,exItem)) # heuristic based on text similarity
            - may be resolved back to bill_id
                - for each bill_id mentioned by multiple exItems, only the last
                  one gets a mtype='announcement' response.
- Motion-Ex
    - meeting(mtype='exmotion',exItem) => bill_id              # at INSERT, or.
        - May have an actual discussion order but not referenced in the future
        - Replies in future motion may refer back to the exItem
- Motino-Meta
    - meeting(mtype='meta-discussion'|'meta-announcement')
        - Possible reference to discussion/announcement within the same meeting
    - 復議案 = reference to cross-meeting announcement
        - Outcome: UPDATE previous meeting's announcement to deleted
